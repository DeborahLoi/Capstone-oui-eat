## Viewport
the website is built on a viewport of 1278 px. Its not responsive

## No server needed
Didn't need a server. All my data base are in json files. 
I will creaste it later to be able to create API for the comment section

## Loggin section
I will use Passport.js. An authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.

## home page
The website assumes the user is already connected

For the flow and the tools used you can refereto the roadmap template downloaded with the project.

API get : with use effect with ingredients as a dependency

### `Next steps`

1:Create a login page

2:Caring is sharing page needs to be built. And it will need to create an API address in the server to be abble to post the comments, the likes, and the vues of the users.
