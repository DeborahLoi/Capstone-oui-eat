# Project OUI EAT
The project is a website that helps users create shopping lists based on their preferred ingredients and provides a nutriment score for each ingredient. The site also suggests recipes based on the ingredients in the shopping list and allows users to share recipes and healthy eating tips to promote a healthier lifestyle.

### `Next steps`

1:Create a login page 
Also i need to seed a data base for the users

2:Caring is sharing page needs to be built. And it will need to create an API address in the server to be abble to post the comments, the likes, and the vues of the users.
